                <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. I work with <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/gorelab/">Mike Gore</a> and <a href="https://www.yingsun.info/yingsun">Ying Sun</a> focusing on the development/application of crop growth models using remote sensing data. I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Biology/Molecular Plant Sciences at Michigan State University where I worked with <a href="http://www.berkleywalker.org">Berkley Walker</a> studying plant physiology and biochemistry. Prior to that, I earn my B.S. in Biology with minors in Chemistry and Leadership Studies at Slippery Rock University.</p>
<h1 id="research-directions">Research Directions</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Plant Physiology Interests</strong>:
I am broadly interested in understanding the physiological constraints placed on plant performance by their environment. Moreover, I have spent a most of my time in academia exploring the unique challenges plants will face in future climate conditions. This has led me to pursue a variety of research questions that sit at the intersection of remote sensing, plant physiology and biochemistry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming/Modeling Interests</strong>:
I have found that programming (primarily in R) has provided valuable assistance in helping me construct, validate, and visualize biological phenomena in my research. Whether pre-processing unstructured data, evaluating specific variables through modeling, running descriptive statistics, or data visualization, all have helped me make informed decisions and conclusions about my research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Educational Research Interests</strong>:
I have found through my experience in higher education, that teaching/mentoring provides me with a sense of fulfillment untouched by my research efforts. When thinking about teaching the next generation of scientist/leaders in STEM, I resonate the most with this quote from (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2005):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do we make it more likely — by our design — that students really understand what they are asked to learn?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are scholarly approaches to teaching and learning which can be implemented and analyzed to assess student learning. I found that using some of these approaches during my academic experience has enhanced my ability to teach/mentor.</p>
