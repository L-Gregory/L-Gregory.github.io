*The goal of education should not be to cover information, but to uncover it*


**Chapter Summary**: This chapter introduces the concept of backward design, a perspective/practice that prioritizes understanding when designing educational units.

Wiggins and McTighe advocate for the use of Backwards Design in classrooms and spend the beginning of the chapter discussing the shortcomings of traditional instructional design, which can be attributed to two major factors: weak design and excessive coverage.  

1.  *Weak Educational Design*: Wiggins and McTighe argue that weak educational design can hinder students' ability to understand. Often, instructors focus on the development of fun/enjoyable active-learning activities, and neglect how these activities will lead to any understanding. Therefore, these activities characteristically have a *"hands-on, without minds-on"* effect on our students'. Effective design should promote understanding by providing a clear purposes and explicit performance goals.

2. *Excessive Coverage*: Historically, educators have prioritized content and textbooks rather than focusing directly on the desired learning outcomes. Students are over-saturated and overwhelmed with content, but are expected to  *"march thorough the textbook"* within a set time frame, attempting to absorb as much as possible. Wiggins and McTighe use the film *If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium* to illustrate that this pedagogical approach is like taking a whirlwind tour of Europe (i.e., where the emphasis is to see as much as possible, without fostering any intellectual insights or understanding). However, the authors point out that a purposeful survey of a discipline is needed to provide students an general overview, but emphasize that this should be done mindfully. 


**Interpretation & Reflection**:

After reading the chapter and discussing it with other FAST fellows, the most significant takeaway as I reflect is that instructors can (*backwards*) design educational material so that the students can take ownership of the content, instead of the instructor. 

From my experience in the classroom and general observation, student confidence increases when they know what is expected of them right up front. Backward design places the learning objective at the forefront, offering students transparency regarding what understanding is required to achieve the learning goals and how to demonstrate their understanding in performance tasks. As a person who enjoys structure/organization, I have incorporating Backwards Design when creating learning experiences for the people I teach or have trained during my PhD. For instance, I implemented this [backwards design](/BackwardsDesign_REU.pdf) when I trained/mentored an NSF-REU student for 10-weeks during the summer of 2022. 

That being said, backward design does pose practical challenges when it is first being incorporated into a learning module, or curriculum. One major drawback is the design process which can be time-consuming - especially for educators unfamiliar with this approach or thinking in reverse. However, this drawback is not enough to totally disregard the practice of backwards design. It might be more practical (and would be my recommendation) for educators who want to adopt backwards design into their classrooms to do so incrementally. Therefore, educators would revamp one or two units per year instead of overhauling the entire curriculum at once. 

Another challenge I foresee could be the rigidity of the template. Like, once an instructor fills out a backwards design template for a unit, it may feel somewhat like the lesson is set in stone. By having a template written so specific (i.e., Stage 3 - Learning Plan), real-time adjustments may not be able to be made. This is not good, because students need to engage with the learning material in an unscripted and authentic setting in the classroom. To remedy this, backwards design will benefits students the most when student feedback is incorporated into the design process, and the "template" is updated in real-time or annually.
