**Literature Summary**: 

*Science Teaching*: Handelsman et al., argue that science education needs to be reformed and that teaching needs the same level of rigor scientific research. They go into specific details about there call to action in the following sections: Implementing changes in lectures, designing educational materiel where students can become scientists, and recommendations for university reform to promote education change. 

*Challenge faculty to transform STEM learning*: In their work, Cooper et al. advocate for a transformation in STEM education, with a primary focus on biology, chemistry, and physics. They propose a restructuring of pedagogical practices to prioritize three key elements: core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and scientific practices. Cooper et al., argument revolves around the notion that students who have succeeded in traditional educational formats are an exception, rather than the norm, but by emphasizing these critical areas (i.e., core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and scientific practices) it becomes possible for *all students* to achieve a more profound understanding of science. 

**Interpretation & Reflection**:

The article (*Science Teaching*) came out just about 20-years ago, and likely set the groundwork into changing science education.

The article begins by discussing how traditional lecture approaches (i.e., memorization and regurgitation practices) and cookie-cutter labs are inadequate to facilitate conceptual or scientific reasoning. Instead, Handelsman et al. advocate for active approaches that are designed to be more discovery/inquiry-based (i.e., giving the ownership of the content to the student). The authors reference the SCALE-UP (i.e., Student-Centered Activities for Large-Enrollment Undergraduate Programs) program from the NCSU.

  - *SCALE-UP*: SCALE-UP classrooms are set up like a wedding reception with groups of large round tables that house up to 8-10 students, rather than the traditional neat-rows of combo desk. Designing spaces like this promote collaborative learning (i.e., peer-to-peer discussion and debate) while neat-rows isolate student interaction. These small student groups work together as a team on in-class activities, or exercises while the instructor circulates around the room. All of these in-class activities challenge students to work at the upper-levels of Bloom's taxonomy (i.e., synthesize, evaluate, construct) instead of the lower-levels (i.e., describe, list, restate) - which in my opinion is what classrooms should be doing. SCALE-UP classrooms were inspired by the principle behind Vygotsky's social cognition (referenced below).
 
In the last section of the policy forum, Handelsman et al. provides examples of how universities can reform education to create effective teaching approaches and get away from traditional memorization and regurgitation practices. 

About 11 years after the Science Teaching policy forum was published, Cooper et al. came out with their article on reforming teaching and learning science at the university level through prioritization of core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and scientific practices. The authors note that it is just not these three areas taken/developed separately, but all three need to be integrated together. The combination of these three is denoted as three-dimensional learning (3DL) by Cooper et al. I think that this is a wicked *Framework* (i.e., a scaffold for educators to develop effective teaching and learning experiences) to use in the classroom. I am currently working on a Teach-as-research project as part of my FAST fellowship, where I will be using 3D-learning to scaffold my instruction.  

Also, all of the authors from Cooper et al. are from Michigan State (Go Green! Go White!). It makes me proud to be a Spartan where educational research that is backed by evidence (i.e., making instructional decisions/design strategies based on that empirical evidence) is valued.
