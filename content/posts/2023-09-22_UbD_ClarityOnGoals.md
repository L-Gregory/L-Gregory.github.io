*Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. (SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard; 1843)*

**Chapter Summary**: The first stage of backwards design in determining the desired result. This is not just a simple sentence for learning outcomes, but is composed of an *Established Goals*, *Essential Question(s)*, *Understanding*, and *Acquired Key Knowledge and Transferable Skills*". The chapter defines and discusses in detail terminology, how it fits into constructing a "desired result", and why there is a need for greater clarity, cohesion, and validity in our educational learning goals. Below are the definitions of the new terminology that I think are important to commit to memory:

- *Established Goals*: Broad, long-term priorities that are achievable and are agreed upon at the federal, state, or department-level. Success for Established goal(s) are reflected in learning objective and outcomes. These goals establish what to teach, what to leave out, what to emphasize, and what to minimize.
- *Essential Question*: Highlight the big ideas that are central to the design - ideas that the work will require students to address. When crafting an essential question it is more appropriate to develop a question that "can be seriously pursued", rather than a question that "can be answered" (be committed to genuine inquiry!).
- *Understanding*: The transferable big ideas that gives the content meaning that links the facts and skills. The result of the students to make sense of the work and/or lessons, using inquiry, performance, and reflection. 
- *Key Knowledge*: Facts and concepts form a lesson and gained from learning and teaching activities.
- *Skills*: discrete techniques, that can range from simple to complex procedures and methods. These focus on approaches and processes (i.e., long division, ) rather than performance goals (i.e., make impact data visualizations, or write a powerful essay). What skills will students be able to do by the lesson/units end?

**Interpretation & Reflection**:

As I start to put together my teaching-as-research (TAR) project for the FAST fellowship, a chapter like this are important to link my learning question to the learning objective(s) (i.e., specific, targeted measurement that provides evidence to the question) to the desired result. I think it is important to take all of this new terminology into account when defining a lesson or new unit to ensure that the learning activity is tied to a established goal. If these terms are not taken into consideration then your lesson may suffer from 1) aimless coverage, and 2) isolated activities that are merely engaging, while disconnecting from intellectual goals in the mind of the student. 

For me, learning should be more that just memorizing facts and oassing tests of recall and recognition. Learning needs to be coupled with understanding (as defined above). Memorizing key knowledge will only get students ready for trivia contents, but learning with understanding around core ideas allows students to link and conceptualize key knowledge (like adding a new piece of Velcro to there heads). John Dewey's (American Educational Reformer) made the observation that knowledge for the most part is "apprehended", while understandings must be "comprehended". 
     
I also think that when identifying Established Goals in a discipline or a class, stakeholders (i.e., future employers of our students) need to be considered as well. Higher education, in most cases, is professional/career development for our students and we need to make sure that they are learning essential skills for the workforce.
