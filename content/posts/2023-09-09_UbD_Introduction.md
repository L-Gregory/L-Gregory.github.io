In this book, the question arises: *How do we make it more likely — by our design — that more students really understand what they are asked to learn?*

**Chapter Summary**: This chapter introduces the book and a few key terms that are important to commit to memory. The terms are:
- *Curriculum*: refers to the specific blueprint for learning that is derived from the desired result. Curriculum takes content (from external standards and local goals) and shapes it into a plan for how to conduct effective and engaging teaching and learning.
- *Desired Results*: are what student should be able to know, do, and understand upon leaving the classroom (also known as intended outcomes, achievement targets, or performance standards).
- *Assessment*: act of determining the extent to which the desired results are on the way to being achieved and to what extent they have been achieved. 
- *Evaluation*: is more summative and credential-related
_ *Understanding*:  is to make connections and bind together our knowledge into something that makes sense of things (whereas without understanding we might see only unclear, isolated, or unhelpful facts).

**Interpretation & Reflection**:

Although this is just the introduction, I did gain some insights into terminology commonly used by instructors and educators. What stood out to me the most was the distinction between assessment and evaluation, which I have often used interchangeably, but I realize have distinct roles in education. 

- *Assessment* is geared towards providing opportunities for feedback and improvement, often in a  formative sense. 
- *Evaluation* is more of a high-stakes examination, often serving a summative purpose. 

After reading the chapter and reflecting on these two terms, I realize I have observed assignments and evaluations in action during on a previous TA-ship (upper-level Plant Physiology). For context, the course had 28 upper-level undergraduate students, and the teaching duties were split between two professors (i.e., one for the first and one for the second half of the semester). I hated this "co-teaching" style - but that's another story. Anyways...

The initial instructor of the course had structured the classroom in a flipped manner, where the students watched videos before class, then participate in collaborative learning during the class period. These in-class activities fostered an environment in which students could engage with questions and enabled the instructor and I to interact with the students in Socratic dialogue. To me, these in-class activities felt like an assessment, where we provided opportunities for feedback during the class period, and could make real-time adjustments to the lesson plan based on their current understanding of the material. Meanwhile, the midterm exam was designed in alignment with these in-class exercises, ensuring transparency and consistency in the evaluation process for our students. This was very much a summative, and "high-stakes" evaluation.

The idea of assessment/evaluations always remind of a Harry Potters analogy. The witches and wizards at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are expected to leave Hogwarts with the ability/confidence to casting spells and make potions. Therefore, during their years at Hogwarts, students are evaluation to independently cast spells and/or make potions. Since, this is the exception, the professors at Hogwarts actively engage with students through in-class discussion, individual feedback, or performing the spells alongside the students. This is great because it benefits the students to practice what they are going to be assessed on in a "low-stakes" way. I feel like this is where the actual learning happens for (fictional or non-fictional) students. Students need to engage in on-going, formative assessments to hone their skills and knowledge, under the guidance of their educators.  

While it may seem more convenient for educators to rely solely on high-stakes summative evaluations (i.e., traditional approach, ease of grading, etc.), it's important for instructors to recognize that students benefit the most from formative experiences. Therefore, as instructors, we must design our curricula to incorporate both assignments and evaluations, all aimed to promoting a deeper understanding of the learning material to help our students succeed and reach our intended learning outcomes.
