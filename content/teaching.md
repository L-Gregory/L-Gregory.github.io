In today's data rich society, the public is being asked to comprehend/interpret vast amounts of information to make informed decisions across various contexts. This demand underscores the critical need for individuals to possess strong *quantitative reasoning* and *interdisciplinary thinking* skills. Teaching at the college level offers an opportunity to improve students' proficiency in these areas, equipping them with the essential tools not only to excel academically but also to navigate real-world challenges. In my classroom, I aim to cultivate an environment where students can practice the scientific method, enhance their data literacy abilities, and improve their confidence in making data-driven decisions.

#### FAST fellow (2023-2024)
I was selected as a FAST (Future Academic Scholars in Teaching) Fellow as part of a  [program](https://grad.msu.edu/fast) that was developed in response to the national need to prepare future faculty for the changing needs and expectations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. As a part of this fellowship, I conducted a Teaching-as-Research (TAR) project aimed to improve quantitative reasoning ability and confidence in undergraduate students.

#### Certification in College Teaching 
Additional to my Ph.D., I obtained a graduate certification in College Teaching through the College of Natural Science. During this certification I have enhanced my teaching capacity in five main competency areas:

1. **Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies** - [read more](/Comp1.pdf)

2. **Creating Effective Learning Environments** - [read more](/Comp2_PDF.pdf)

3. **Incorporating Technology in Teaching** - [read more](/Comp3_PDF.pdf)

4. **Understanding the University Context** - [read more](/Comp4_PDF.pdf)

5. **Assessing Student Learning** - [read more](/Comp5_PDF.pdf) 

#### Teaching Artifacts
Over the course of the teaching certification and the FAST fellowship, I have developed various learning materials that are visible below.

 * **Undergraduate Plant Physiology sample syllabus**:

 * **Backward Design Framework**: To see a backward design I developed for an REU student who spent 10-week in the lab with me ([click here](/BackwardsDesign_REU.pdf)), or in preparation for 25-minute micro-lecture on the light reactions of photosynthesis ([click here](/BackwardsDesign_Photosynthesis.pdf)).
 * **Plant physiology exercises for developing quantitative reasoning**: As a part of my Teaching-as-Research project, I developed three quantitative reasoning exercises aligned with learning modules (plant-water relations, photosynthesis, and metabolism) in an upper-level Plant Physiology course.
    * [Plant-Water Relations](/QRE_PlantWaterRelations.pdf), [Photosynthesis](/QRE_Photosynthesis.pdf), [Central Metabolism](/QRE_Metabolism.pdf)
 * **Cooperative learning**: I was given the opportunity to teach a 25-minute microlesson to my FAST cohort and the FAST/CIRTL steering committee to incorporate and demonstrate cooperative learning in the lesson.
