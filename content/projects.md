# Projects 

*Dissertation*: My Ph.D. dissertation seeks to reveal adapted/acclimated strategies within the photorespiratory pathway that enable C3 plants to thrive at elevated temperatures. The following projects outline the details of this work:

* **Can photorespiration adapt to elevated temperatures?**
  * Get a [quick summary](/GRC_Gregory.pdf) and/or read the [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pce.14711)
* **Can photorespiration acclimate to elevated temperatures?**
  * Answers coming soon!
* **Can photorespiratory capacity be improved to increases net carbon fixation at elevated temperatures?**
  * Answers coming soon!

*Modeling Projects*: Throughout my academic journey, I've engaged in collaborations with others and personally built custom tools for analyzing plant physiological processes. See these projects below:

* **Modeling CO2 response curves**
  * See the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/L-Gregory/msuRACiFit) and/or read the corresponding [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pce.14153)
* **Fitting a Post Illumination CO2 Burst**
  * Use the [ShinyApp](https://l-gregory.shinyapps.io/pib_analyzer/) 
* **Streamline chemical preparation for photorespiration enzyme assays**
  * Use the [ShinyApp](https://l-gregory.shinyapps.io/photorespiratoryassay_recipes/)
